# example_drake_project
An example of a functional `drake` project used for an intro workshop using Fanaee-T and Gama's (2013) [bike sharing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

The project was an example `drake` workflow used in my fall 2020 [CEREO](https://cereo.wsu.edu/) 1/2 day `drake` workshop for graduate students. This is paired with a [walkthrough document](https://mbrousil.github.io/drake_wkshp) that I adapted from the workshop materials. The document is roughly formatted for workshops styled after the [Carpentries](http://carpentries.org/).
